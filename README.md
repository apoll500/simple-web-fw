# simple-web-fw
A simple highly modular framework for building websites and web-applications based on JavaScript and PHP.

The aim of this project is to support the generation of the client- and server-side part at once, while taking care of different versions with respect to localization and design variations.
This project should provide the basic code for future modules that will be generated completely automatically using prokee/bmc.
All generated code and all code of the framework is pure JS/PHP code. There are no other dependencies besides prokee/bmc and baseman (for package management).

Remarks on the state of development:

1) Although parts of the code are rather old, this project is still very much at the beginning.
Little progress has been made in the past months. I think, that the basic idea of this project is still valid and worth continuing.
At the same time, I have to say that I currently do not have the time to develop this project any further.

2) The code was intentionally kept very old fashioned by avoiding more modern concepts of JavaScript. The reason for this, was the plan to some day implement an interpreter for a small subset of JavaScript, which would then be sufficient to run this code. A critical review suggests, that this was probably not the best approach for this project.
As a consequence, a basic redesign of the code would be very necessary.

3) This project is now on hold and will not be continued for the foreseeable future.
