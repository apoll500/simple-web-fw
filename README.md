# simple-web-fw
A simple highly modular framework for building websites and web-applications based on JavaScript and PHP.

The aim is to generate the client- and server-side part at once, while taking care of different versions with respect to localization and design variations.

The following tools are used (optionally):

- baseman ....... for module management
- prokee/bmc .... for automated customizations

There are no other dependencies.
All code is pure JS/PHP code.

This project intentionally avoids all modern approaches to JS and rather follows a more old fashioned JS programming style. The reason for this is, to keep everything as simple as possible to allow the implementation of an lightweight browser, which then only will have to understand a very small subset of JavaScript.
