# simple-web-fw
A simple highly modular framework for building websites and web-applications based on JavaScript and PHP.

The aim is to generate the client- and server-side part at once, while taking care of different versions with respect to localization and design variations.

The following tools are used (optionally):

- baseman ....... for module management
- prokee/bmc .... for automated customizations

There are no other dependencies.
All code is pure JS/PHP code.
